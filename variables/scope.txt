Ruby Variable Scope: A Quick Reference

Ruby has variables defined within different scopes, which you
probably know already.  I found that most tutorials describe
them briefly (the variable types), but they fail to mention
precisely what their scope is.  Here are the details:

o Class variable (@@a_variable): Available from the class definition
  and any sub-classes.  Not available from anywhere outside.

o Instance variable (@a_variable): Available only within a specific
  object, across all methods in a class instance.  Not available
  directly from class definitions.

o Global variable ($a_variable): Available everywhere within your Ruby script.

o Local variable (a_variable): It depends on the scope.  Youâ€™ll be
  working with these most and thus encounter the most problems, because
  their scope depends on various things.
